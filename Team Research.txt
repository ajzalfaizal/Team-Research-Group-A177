This dataset is interesting because as a teenager and being a part of a significant consumer demographic,analysing this data helps us to understand how our generations opinion differ from older ones



INDEPENDENT VARIABLE - AGE
*****************************

Reason - Age influence on other variables on the dataset such as ratings,recommendations

Behavior - Age does not change based on other factors of the dataset


INTERNAL / MEASUREMENT DATA 
_____________________________

   - This type of data is numerical and continuous

Characteristics

. Numerical
. Ordered (ages can be ranked, eg : age 20 is younger than 30)


DEPENDENT VARIABLE - RATING
*******************************

Reason - The rating customers gives from ( 1- 5 ) could be influenced by factors like age or other variables, different age group gives different ratings

Behavior -  Rating changes based on various factors making it a good candidate for measureing the effect pf other variables like age, product category or positive feedback

ORDINAL
_____________________________

 -  This type of data is categorical data with clear order/ranking 

 Characteristics

 > Ordered
 > No equal intervals
 > Categorical Nature  (even represented with numbers, the values are categories indicating levels of satisfaction



RESEARCH QUESTION
**************************
> Research Question (RQ):
Is there a correlation between rating and age?

Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H0)
There is no correlation between rating and age.
-----------------------------------------------
Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
There is a correlation between rating and age.





// WE WOULD USE TEMPLATE 1 BECAUSE BOTH VARIABLES ARE ORDINAL OR INTERVAL
AGE - INTERVAL
RATING - ORDINAL
